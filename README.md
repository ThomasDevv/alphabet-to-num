# alphabet-to-num
Converts alphabetical letters to their corresponding numerical values.

# How does this script work?
This script works by first checking if the argument passed is a string. If so, it proceeds to create an empty array. Then it converts the argument to an array, starts iterating over it, converts the element at the current iteration to lowercase and then grabs its unicode value to decrease it by 96 in order to grab its corresponding numerical value. Then it pushes the results to the empty array and returns that array.
